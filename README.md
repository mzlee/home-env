# home-env

A single bash environment for all of the machines.

The aliases, functions, and environment is set up in bash.d and are
evaluated in sorted order.  `bash50_*` is ignored and hence a
customization on individual machines.

The actual bash line is now almost universally powered by
powerline-bash (/via [milkbikis](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell))
